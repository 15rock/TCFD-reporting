# 15Rock is proud to share a TCFD reporting survey.

The underlying and main pillars are TCFD. Our goal is:

- Simplicity 
  - At different levels of company's maturity (startups to large fortune 500s)
  - Different levels of technical understanding
  - Different levels of impact journey
- Cross-industry comparability
- Compatible with a wide range of standards to help consolidate reporting burdens for corporations

We are proud to provide a free list of questions. The application to process this is avail at 15Rock if you want to report and share your reports easily with others(which also have a free tier).
