# 15Rock is proud to share an open-source TCFD reporting survey.

We believe increasing transparency and access would help us all work together to fight climate change. The underlying and main pillars are TCFD. Our goal is:

- Simplicity 
  - At different levels of company's maturity (startups to large fortune 500s)
  - Different levels of technical understanding
  - Different levels of impact journey
- Cross-industry comparability
- Compatible with a wide range of standards to help consolidate reporting burdens for corporations

We are proud to provide a free list of questions. The application to process this is avail at [15Rock](https://www.15rock.com/) if you want to report and share your reports easily with others(which also have a free tier).

This project was led by: [Dr Muhammad Sajjad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-sajjad-ph-d-05590865/) from Hong Kong. We thank him for his excellent work and generous support of this project.

Due to the lack of information on such emissions  in relatively new businesses (i.e., startups), a good approach might be to  use quarterly aggregations for comparison and clarity. Include data on  various sectoral emissions, such as operations, supply chain, energy, and so  on. The details of Scopes 1, 2, and 3 would also be included in this section.  Finally, if there are any initiatives to offset carbon emissions, let us know  about them. If there is any interest, this could be accomplished through a  small case study. | Primarily for Mid-Level and  Senior Campanies    | 7              | 2                  |
